## Here's what I did in project 2:
My partner and I were calling through facebook messenger the whole time we worked on it. I shared the code over VScode and we worked on the code together going through it very organically. If i was doing one part and then Emily was doing the next. And we came together to see that these both worked and then worked together. When the file look almost complete we both went into testing mode, finding bugs and fixing them as we we went all together.
